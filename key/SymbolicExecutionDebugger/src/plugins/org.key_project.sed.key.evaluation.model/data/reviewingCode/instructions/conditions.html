      <h1>Reviewing Code</h1>
      <p>
         The goal of the evaluation is to compare direct source code review with an inspection using the <a href="http://www.key-project.org/eclipse/SED/index.html" target="_blank">Symbolic Execution Debugger (SED)</a>.
         During the evaluation, four or six code examples and related questions will be shown to you. 
         You can contribute to the evaluation by answering these questions as best as you can.
         The evaluation usually takes about 60 minutes.
      </p>

         Please read all instructions carefully. 
         <b>You can do nothing wrong as long as you answer all questions as best as you can.</b>
