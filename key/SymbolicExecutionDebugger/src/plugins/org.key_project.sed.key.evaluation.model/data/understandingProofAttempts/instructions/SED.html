      <p>
         The <a href="http://www.key-project.org/eclipse/SED/index.html" target="_blank">Symbolic Execution Debugger (SED)</a> is a platform for interactive symbolic execution.
         Using KeY as symbolic execution engine, sequential Java programs specified with JML can be symbolically executed.
         In this evaluation the SED will be used to inspect proofs attempts. Interactive symbolic execution is not required.

      <h2><a name="set">2 Symbolic Execution</a></h2>
      <p>
         Symbolic execution allows to explore all feasible execution paths of a program at once.
         This is achieved by using symbolic values in lieu of concrete values.
         Whenever the knowledge about a symbolic value is not enough to follow a single execution path,
         symbolic execution splits to cover all feasible execution paths.
         This results in a so called <i>symbolic execution tree</i>.
      </p> 
      <p>
         Consider for instance the following Java program.
         Method <code>equals</code> checks whether the given <code>Number</code> instance has the same <code>content</code> as the current one.
         <code>
         <pre>
public class Number {
   private int content;

   /*@ requires true;
     @ ensures true;
     @ assignable \nothing;
     @*/
   public boolean equals(/*@ nullable @*/ Number n) {
      if (content == n.content) {
         return true;
      }
      else {
         return false;
      }
   }
}</pre></code>
      </p>
      <p>
         The resulting symbolic execution tree of method <code>equals</code> is shown in the following figure.
         The root is a <i>start</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/thread.gif" />) representing the program fragment to execute.
         It also restricts the initial state according to the JML specification.
         As we are interested in method <code>equals</code>, it is called next represented by a <i>method call</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/method_call.gif" />).
         The if statement is supposed to split execution and thus represented as <i>branch statement</i> (<img src="SED/icons/branch_statement.gif" />).
         The conditions under which a branch is taken are shown as <i>branch condition</i> nodes (<img src="SED/icons/branch_condition.gif" />).
         In case that <code>n</code> is <code>null</code>, the method returns with an uncaught <code>NullPointerException</code> indicated by the <i>exceptional method return</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/exceptional_method_return.gif" />).
         Finally, this path terminates exceptionally shown by the <i>exceptional termination</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/exceptional_termination.gif" />).
         In case that <code>n</code> is not <code>null</code>, a return statement is executed. As this statement is not supposed to split execution, a <i>statement</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/statement.gif" />) is used.
         The <i>method return</i> nodes (<img src="SED/icons/method_return.gif" />) indicate that a called method returns. Possible return values of non void methods are shown as part of the node label.
         Finally, a <i>termination</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/termination.gif" />) indicate that an execution path terminates normally without an uncaught exception.
      </p>
      <p>
         The blue rectangles in the figure below group related nodes like an <code>if</code> statement or a method body.
      </p>
      <img src="SED/SED_SymbolicExecutionTree.png" />

      <h3><a name="set_mc">2.1 Symbolic Execution with Method Contracts</a></h3>
      <p>
         A method call can be treated by inlining or by application of a method contract during symbolic execution.
         Inlining of a method body as in the previous example is represented by a <i>method call</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/method_call.gif" />) and later after execution of the method body by a <i>method return</i> (<img src="SED/icons/method_return.gif" />) or <i>exceptional method return</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/exceptional_method_return.gif" />).
      </p> 
      <p>
         The following example explains the alternative to apply a method contract instead of inlining.
         Method <code>doubleValue</code> calls method <code>doDoubleValue</code> which should be treated during symbolic execution by applying its contract.
         The resulting symbolic execution tree contains a <i>method contract</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/method_contract.gif" />) showing the applied contract as first order formula in KeY syntax.
         The optional child branch conditions indicate that execution is continued in case of normal (<i>post</i>) or exceptional (<i>exceptional post</i>) termination of the called method.
         <code>
         <pre>
public class IntegerUtil {
   public static int doubleValue(int x) throws Exception {
      return doDoubleValue(x);
   }
   
   /*@ normal_behavior
     @ requires x >= 0;
     @ ensures \result == x + x;
     @ also
     @ exceptional_behavior
     @ requires x < 0;
     @ signals (Exception) true;
     @*/
   private static /*@ pure @*/ int doDoubleValue(int x) throws Exception;
}</pre></code>
      </p>
      <img src="SED/SED_MC.png" />

      <h3><a name="set_li">2.2 Symbolic Execution with Loop Invariants</a></h3>
      <p>
         A loop is always treated in this evaluation by applying the specified loop invariant.
         Consider for instance the following example.
         The <i>loop invariant</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/loop_invariant.gif" />) shows the specified loop invariant as first order formula in KeY syntax.
         It also splits symbolic execution into two branches.
         The <i>Body Preserves Invariant</i> branch represents an arbitrary loop iteration.
         After execution of loop guard and loop body, the branch terminates indicated by the <i>loop body termination</i> node (<img src="SED/icons/loop_body_termination.gif" />).
         The <i>Use Case</i> branch continues execution after an arbitrary number of loop iterations after the loop.
         <code>
         <pre>
public class LoopExample {
   /*@ normal_behavior
     @ requires x >= 0;
     @ ensures \result == 0;
     @*/
   public static int decrease(int x) {
      /*@ loop_invariant x >= 0;
        @ decreasing x;
        @ assignable x;
        @*/      
      while (x > 0) {
         x--;
      }
      return x;
   }
}</pre></code>
      </p>
      <img src="SED/SED_LI.png" />

      <h3><a name="verification">2.3 Proving by Symbolic Execution</a></h3>
      <p>
         Termination (<img src="SED/icons/termination_not_verified.gif" />) and exceptional termination (<img src="SED/icons/exceptional_termination_not_verified.gif" />) nodes indicate by a red crossed icon if the postcondition (including assignable clause and uncaught exceptions) could not be proven to be correct. 
         A method contract (<img src="SED/icons/method_contract_not_pre.gif" />) node is also marked by a red crossed icon if the precondition of the applied contract could not be proven to be correct.
         Finally, a loop invariant (<img src="SED/icons/loop_invariant_initially_invalid.gif" />) node is crossed out if the loop invariant could not be proven to hold initially and the loop body termination (<img src="SED/icons/loop_body_termination_not_verified.gif" />) node is crossed if the loop invariant (including decreasing and assignable clause) could not be proven to be preserved.
      </p>      
      <p>
         <b>A symbolically executed method is correct iff 
            <ol>
               <li>all execution paths end in a termination, exceptional termination or loop body termination node and</li>
               <li>none of the nodes in the full symbolic execution tree is red crossed.</li>
            </ol>      
         </b>
      </p>
      <p>
         If a method could not be proven correct, possible reasons are:
         <ul>
           <li>The analyzed source code is buggy which caused a state in which the Java program does not fulfill its specification.</li>
           <li>
              The strategy of KeY was stopped to early or is not powerful enough to close the proof automatically. 
              In this case it is possible to close the proof interactively outside of SED.
           </li>

      <h2><a name="sed">3 User Interface of the Symbolic Execution Debugger (SED)</a></h2>
      <p>
         The Symbolic Execution Debugger offers a new perspective named <i>Symbolic Debug</i> which offers everything related to symbolic execution:
         <ul>
            <li>The <i>Debug</i> view allows to switch between debug sessions.</li>
            <li>View <i>Symbolic Execution Tree</i> visualizes the symbolic execution tree of the current debug session. A thumbnail for navigation purpose is available in view <i>Symbolic Execution Tree (Thumbnail)</i>.</li>
            <li>View <i>Variables</i> shows the symbolic state of the currently selected node (before it is executed).</li>
            <li>Additional information about the selected node or variable are shown in view <i>Properties</i>.</li>
            <li>Views <i>Breakpoints</i> and <i>Symbolic Execution Settings</i> allows to control symbolic execution. <b>They are not needed for this evaluation as full symbolic execution trees will be offered.</b></li>
            <li>The source code related to the selected node is also highlighted in the opened editor (here <i>Number.java</i>). All statements and code members considered during symbolic execution are also highlighted by a yellow background.</li>

      <h3><a name="state">3.1 Inspecting a Symbolic State</a></h3>
      <p>
         Each node in the symbolic execution tree represents the state before a statement is executed. 
         The state can be inspected after selection of the node of interest in view <i>Variables</i>.
         In contrast to a concrete execution, symbolic values are shown in column <i>Value</i>.
         Additional constraints are shown after selecting a variable in view <i>Properties</i> at tab <i>Constraints</i>.
      </p>
      <img src="SED/SED_Variables.png" />      
      
      <h3><a name="layout">3.2 Visualizing Memory Layouts</a></h3>
      <p>
         A symbolic execution path is representative for possibly infinite concrete executions with different memory layouts.
         The SED allows to visualize all possible memory layouts by selecting context menu item <i>Visualize Memory Layouts</i> of a node.
      </p>
      <p>
         This opens a new diagram editor in perspective <i>State Visualization</i>.
         The rectangle with rounded corners represents the current state which points to objects on the heap (rectangles).
         Lower compartments of objects show field variables with their symbolic values while the lower compartment of the current state shows local variables with their symbolic values.
         The red rectangles between arrows show the name of the represented variable/location.
      </p>
      <p>
         The slider in the editor allows to switch between possible memory layouts while
         the radio buttons define if the current or the initial state before execution started is shown.

      <h3><a name="truth">3.3 Comprehension of Truth Values of Postconditions, Preconditions and Loop Invariants</a></h3>
      <p>
         KeY tries to evaluate postconditions within a proof after symbolic execution has finished. 
         Additionally, preconditions of applied method contracts and loop invariants are evaluated.
         Nodes which might be marked as unverified by a red cross (see <a href="#verification">1.3 Proving by Symbolic Execution</a>) provides a tab 
         in the <i>Properties</i> view in which the during proof computed truth values of the formula to show are highlighted. 
         The tab is named <i>Postcondition</i> on termination and exceptional termination nodes, <i>Precondition</i> on method call nodes and <i>Loop Invariant</i> on loop invariant and loop body termination nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
         In case that the proof splits in order to evaluate the formula, for each leaf (goal) is a group composite shown named after the unique ID of the leaf.
         In the example below, the proof does not split and thus only one group named <i>Node 29</i> is available.
         Each group shows on the left of the implication arrow <code>==></code> the split condition and on the right the to be proven formula.
         Formulas evaluated to true are colored in green, terms evaluated to false are colored in red and terms colored in yellow are never or not completely evaluated during prove.
         In rare cases KeY splits the proof on a term which has nothing to do with the proven formula.
         In such a case the related part in the split condition is not colored (black).
      </p>
      <p>
         <b>A leaf fulfills the formula to show, iff the left side of the implication arrow <code>==></code> evaluates to false or iff the right side evaluates to true.</b>
         In the example below evaluates the left side to true, thus the only chance to fulfill the formula is to evaluate the right side also to true.
         Let us inspect the terms of the conjunctions (<code>&</code>) more carefully.
         The term <code>exc = null</code> evaluates to true which is what the specification (normal_behavior) says.
         The terms <code>PostconditionEvaluation.x = 42</code> and <code>\forall ...</code> are not completely evaluated.
         Additionally, the second <code>&</code> is colored in red meaning that during prove this operator was evaluated into false (even if the result of its children is not completely evaluated).
         This means the formula can not be evaluated into true and one of the orange parts (ensures and assignable clause) must be buggy.
         An inspection of the termination state in view <i>Variables</i> shows that the value of <code>x</code> is <code>4711</code> and not <code>42</code> as specified.
         We found the bug.
