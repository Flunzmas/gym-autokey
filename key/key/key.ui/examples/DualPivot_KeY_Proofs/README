This folder contains the Java files used for the correctness proof of the JDK sorting 
engine for integer arrays.
We proved that the output is sorted, that it is a permutation of the input, and that 
there are no integer overflows.
These proofs have been separated into different subfolders.
Java's Dual Pivot Quicksort implementation uses three different partitioning styles; 
in order to break down the proof into smaller, more manageable parts, each of these 
partitiong styles was extracted into its own class. The Dual Pivot partition uses 
two pivot elements, the Three Way partition uses only one pivot, and the Swap Pivots 
partition shifts the elements equal to the pivots to the left and right part of the array.
The files used for the correctness proofs of each of these partioning styles are stored
in their respective subfolder (e.g., the proof/permutation/DualPivotQuicksort_perm folder
contains the proof for the permutation property of the dual pivot partitioning algorithm).
