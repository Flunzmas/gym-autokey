Basic idea: 
Run a renaming and compare the editor content to a given oracle, i.e. the result which should be achieved.


1) Each test in its own folder. Separated in src and oracle.
2) First, files are copied and oracle string is generated.
3) Renaming is done (by selection a field/method from the outline or a package from the package explorer).
4) Comparison of editor after renaming to oracle.


@see TestUtilsRefactoring for the methods used in testing.


What is tested:

***** Testing Field Renaming *****

Tested in file FieldRenameRefactoringTest:

Test1: one occurrence in a simple assignable clause
Test2: additional occurrences in requires and ensures clauses
Test3: local variable with the same name (balance) and use of this qualifier
Test4: a field from another class is accessed which has the same name as the field to be renamed (balance).
Test5: the other class accesses and returns the balance field of the main class and thus need to change the name.
Test6: the other class is additionally in another package and instead of returning the balance field of the main class
      it sets the field with the local parameter called balance too.
Test7: more complex usage of balance. More than one member access.
Test8: Changes to the JML code in the other class but no changes to the java code. Other class accesses the balance field
      from the main class by using getBalance() but refers to the field in the JML code.
Test9: Like 8 but with 2 files without java changes.
Test10: change within an invariant.
Test11: combination of this qualifier and method with same name as the field.
Test12: test11 plus a nested field call: TestClass balance; this.balance.balance()
Test13: test12 with changed order: this.balance().balance
Test14: test11/12 with more nesting: this.balance.balance == test.balance.balance().balance
(Resolver problem) Test16: ArrayList access and equals: (classes.get(0)).balance.equals("5")
(Resolver problem) Test17: test16 without the parentheses
Test18: many MemberAccesses and MethodCalls plus distinguishing between String and field: 
         project.getClass().getDeclaredField("balance").equals(balance)

Tests with several projects: Run in file FieldRenameRefactoringTestSeveralProjects:

Test19: Test with 2 Projects. One Project (referencingProject) references the balance-field of another project (referencedProject)
Test20: Additional to test19, the referencingProject has an own field called balance.

Tests with only one project:
Test21: Accessing a field using a fully qualified class name.
Test22: Class invariant but not written above the field it refers to.
Test23: Static field access. Other class is in same package. Thus no package reference before class name needed.
Test24: Using the JML Reference Profile AE.

****** Testing Parameter Renaming *****
Test1: One method, one parameter.
Test2: One method, two parameters, renamed parameter is first.
Test3: One method, two parameters, renamed parameter is second.
Test4: Field with same name. Other method (constructor) using parameter with same name.
Test5: Starting to rename a local variable, not a parameter of a method.

****** Testing Class Renaming (oracle file has the name of the original class name) *****
Test1: One class, one method which uses the class in java code and JML.
Test2: One class, one method which only references the class in JML (twice!), i.e. no java text changes recorded for that class
Test3: Two classes, same package. OtherClass initializes TestClass.
Test4: like Test3 but without any reference to TestClass in OtherClass, thus no java changes in that class.
Test5: Two classes, different package.
Test6: Accessing a class using the fully qualified class name.
Test7: No changes at all. Class with name String is renamed but java.lang.String used in the other class.
Test8: Class to be renamed is referenced in a cast expression.

****** Testing Package Renaming *****
Test1: One class, one package reference in JML.
Test2: Two classes, in same package. Each with one package reference in JML.
Test3: Two classes, in same package. Each with two package references in JML.
Test4: Two classes in the package which will be renamed. One class in otherPackage which references both classes in the renamed package.
- Tests with sub folders:
Test5: Like test4 but package to be renamed is a sub folder.
Test6: One references class is in parent package and one referenced class is in sub package, which is to be renamed. 
Test7: Like test6 but parent package is renamed. The "rename subpackages" option activated.
Test8: Like test7 but option is deactivated - only the parent package is renamed.
Test9: Renaming of an empty Package. TestClass has a field with the same name as the empty and to be renamed package. Checking if the folder was renamed correctly.
Test10: One of the involved classes has no java changes but only changes to the JML annotations.

****** Testing Method Renaming (usually renaming of getBalance() *****
Test1: One class, one method calling another method in that class. No other method with same name in that class.
Test2: Additionally to test1, one other method with same name but different signature in class.
Test3: Like test2 but the method with the other signature, getBalance(boolean), is renamed. Check if getBalance() gets not replaced.
Test4: Like test3 but with getBalance(int) to test differentiating and a getBalance(true) call which needs to change.
Test5: Two classes. TestClass is calling a method from TestClassOther which gets renamed. Same package.
Test6: Two classes. TestClass is calling an own method with the same name and signature like the method which is renamed in TestClassOther.
Test7: Like test4 but TestClassOther is in a different package.
Test8: Nested method calls: getBalance() argument of some other method.
Test9: Nested method calls. getBalance() is argument to another method, valueOf(int).
Test10: Successive method calls: method().getBalance()
Test11: Successive method calls: like 11 but within another method call, i.e. as an argument to another method call.
Test12: Successive method calls: three method calls and getBalance() in the middle.
Test13: Successive method calls: like test 10 but the first method call is (unnecessarily) in a parenthesis.
Test14: Successive method calls: the first method call has two arguments.
Test15: Two classes, same package and getBalance() static.
Test16: Two classes, different packages and getBalance() static.
