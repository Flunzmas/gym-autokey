\n\
This feature provides Visual DbC, a tool to visualize source code together with specifications and proofs.\n\
A proof itself is done interactively by the user in the original user interface of verification tool KeY. \n\
Visual DbC automatically detects references to code and specification elements in a proof and visualize them as proof reference.\n\
\n\
For an optimal user experience it is recommended to use at least the following JVM memory settings:\n\
-Xms128m\n\
-Xmx1024m\n\
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m\n\
\n\
The current settings can be inspected in the configuration tab of the installation details available in the "About Eclipse" dialog. They can be changed in the "eclipse.ini" file or by starting Eclipse with the following additional parameters:\n\
-vmargs -Xms128m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\n\
