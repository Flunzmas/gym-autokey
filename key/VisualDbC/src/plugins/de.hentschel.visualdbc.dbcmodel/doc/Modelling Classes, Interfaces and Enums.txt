Modelling Classes, Interfaces and Enums
=======================================

Solution 1: One Class with an type enum
***************************************

Advantages: 
- Easy diagram model

Disadvantages:
- Every type contains everything, e.g. a class contains enum literals in the graphical definition

Solution 2: Multiple classes for each type
***************************************

Advantages: 
- The graphical definition of a type contains only the relevant information

Disadvantages:
- Very complex diagram model

Solution 3: Generalization Enum => Class => Interface
***************************************

Advantages: 
- Minimal enlarged diagram model

Disadvantages:
- The enum contains properties that it does not have
- Suspect generalization
- Extends relations between enums and interfaces/classes and other combinations are possible

Solution 4: Generalization of abstract Classes: AbEnum => AbClass => AbInterface
***************************************

Advantages: 
- Minimal enlarged diagram model
- The graphical definition of a type contains only the relevant information
- No not allowed extends relations

Disadvantages:
