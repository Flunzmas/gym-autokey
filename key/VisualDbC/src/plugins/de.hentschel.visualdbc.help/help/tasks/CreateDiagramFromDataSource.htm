      <p>
         This task describes how a DbC diagram is created from existing
         source code managed by Eclipse. The source code is stored in a
         project. Visual DbC also provides some <a href="CreateExampleProject.htm">example projects</a> that
         can be created via the example wizard. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Execute the following steps to create a DbC diagram from data source:
         <ol>
            <li>Select the project, folder or package that is used as source directory for diagram generation.</li>
            <li>Open new wizard <a href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard(newWizardId=de.hentschel.visualdbc.generation.ui.wizard.GenerateDiagramWizard)")'>DbC Diagram from Data Source</a>.</li>
            <li>Define diagram file.</li>
            <li>Select "Next >".</li>
            <li>Define domain model file.</li>
            <li>Select "Next >".</li>
            <li>Define a data source and his connection settings.</li>
            <li>Select "Finish". The diagram is created and opened. It is filled with the content provided by the data source.</li>
